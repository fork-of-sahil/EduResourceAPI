# EduResourceAPI (Fyle Backend Challenge)

## Overview
This Python script uses the Flask framework to create a RESTful API server for a education management system. It imports necessary modules and libraries, including Flask's jsonify for creating JSON responses, marshmallow for data validation and deserialization, and SQLAlchemy for database operations.

The script registers several API endpoints related to different roles in a education system: students, teachers, and principals. Each role has its own set of resources, which are registered under their respective URL prefixes. For example, student-related resources are registered under the '/student' URL prefix.

The root endpoint ('/') is defined to return a JSON response indicating that the server is ready, along with the current UTC time.

The script also includes error handling for exceptions. It defines a global error handler that catches all exceptions. If the exception is an instance of FyleError, a custom exception class, it returns a JSON response with the error message. Other types of exceptions are not handled in this snippet.
